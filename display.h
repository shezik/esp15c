 * Not all calculators have the comma.  Some calculators, particularly the
 * classic series, put the '.' inside the seven segments, and dedicate a
 * full digit position to the radix mark.
 *
 * For fourteen-segment displays, by convention the segments are
 * labeled 'a' through 'n'.  We designate '.' and ',' as 'o' and 'p',
 * respectively.  The second dot for the ':' is 'q'.  The segment
 * designations do not match the HP 1LA4 documentation, but rather are
 * based on commercial 14-segment displays such as the Noritake
 * AH1616A 14-segment VFD (though that does not have the second dot
						   * for the colon).
